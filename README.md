# 🌦️ Weather App in Java

A beginner-friendly **Weather App** built in **Java** that shows real-time weather information such as **temperature**, **humidity**, and **wind speed**. This project was developed as part of my learning journey to understand API integration, JSON parsing, and GUI development in Java.

## 📌 Features

- 🌡️ Displays current **Temperature**
- 💧 Shows **Humidity** levels
- 💨 Tracks **Wind Speed**
- 🏙️ City-wise weather search
- 📡 Real-time data from a Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **HTTP Client (e.g., HttpURLConnection or HttpClient)**
- **JSON Parsing** using org.json or Gson
- **GUI** with Java **Swing** or **JavaFX** (depending on your implementation)
- **OpenWeatherMap API** (or any other public weather API)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Working with **APIs** in Java  
- Parsing and processing **JSON** data  
- Designing a simple **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**  
- Handling **user input** and displaying dynamic data
